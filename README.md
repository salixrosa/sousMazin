sousMazin
=========
(*"under the rainclouds"*)

This is an under-development theme built for WordPress 4.3+, designed and built by me, [**Willow Sells**](http://www.willowsells.com).

This theme uses a [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/), so feel free to use the theme, copy the code or design, do pretty much whatever you want.

NOTE: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. This theme works for me; that doesn't mean it'll work for you. Additionally, I do not recommend attempting to use this theme if you are a plugin junky. I have not considered maximizing plugin compatibility in this theme. I am also prone to lecturing people who over-use plugins.

sousMazin 1.0
-------------------------
I don't really do version numbers, but here I am, applying a version number to this theme.

sousMazin 1.0 has many of the same front-end design aspects of the original sousMazin theme. However, the previous theme was less like a WordPress theme and more like a nonsensical combination of lines of code that just happened to do the things I needed them to do. The original sousmazin theme was written, for the most part... a long time ago.

Suffice it to say, sousMazin 1.0 is much more like a WordPress theme done right.
